This is ndnh 2. It's like ndnh 1, but it's based on a newer version of dnh. A lot of stuff from ndnh 1 was a hit and needs to be reimplemented here.
Additonally, there are some new ideas.
- [x] Chaos 1 improvements including mini loot being buffed and add another MAJOR resist
- [x] Full Illithanachronounbinder patch, potentially with some changes but mostly true to the source.
- [x] A very different version of the caveman flint knapping/spearhead point patch
- [x] Potion vapor improvements
- [ ] a likely heavily modified version of the alchemy gnome patch
- [x] A modified version of the caveman 
- [x] Sigil + Fell + spire + key split maybe?
- [x] Village level
- [x] Adventure branches
- [ ] "Collapsed mineshaft" branch from vlad's top level that is just mines end
- [x] Etherealoid race, potentially slightly nerfed
- [ ] Symbiote race, likely better implemented?
- [ ] Cowboy role, complete with a six shooter, lasso, some weird quest, and spurred boots -- not so sure what I was on about with this one. probably no
- [x] Salamander race + rebel salamander quest
- [x] Monk styles, potentially cheaper pw cost
- [ ] Barb Styles, potentially split these off to a new role if chris finds a better way to make barb less OP and more interesting?
- [ ] Pirate king's crown replacing reaver as well as infinite weight treasury of proteus
- [x] Ana salamander + flamethrower
- [ ] Ana nightvision goggles giving extramission
- [ ] Ana hlf force armor
- [x] Ana clkwk loyal to dnh 1 implementation including power armor
- [x] Armorsmith patch
- [x] Do something about sokoban that isn't lokoban -- esolang level (rl time/brain cycles-> game prize) -- haha sike actually lokoban pinata
- [x] Give red dragon scale stuff flying 
- [ ] Special vibe square level
- [ ] Formian race
- [ ] Ent race
- [x] Reimplement achievements and decide what they should be
- [ ] New tats, insight bosses, chaos quests, drow house for drows


Stuff that isn't coming back
- Healer whack healing explosion/crossbow bolt thing
- Spell overloading (until I can figure out how to offer it in a less stupid way)
- Monk -> Mystic name change
- Digout artifact
- Hunting Horn Bard artifact. DNH made singing sword after I made this, and it is way cooler
- Automatic law soldiers likely not returning, or if they do, in a more interesting way
- Portal skip for outlands

More stuff plz give
- [ ] Eth Madman (figment of own imagination (how))
- [ ] Sal Madman
- [ ] Ana Eth (ethergaunt)
- [ ] Sigil upgrade (replace peasants with dabus, make fell fallen, dabus speak, etc)
- [ ] Adventure branch rebalance
